# Bounded backend

The server side of a Bounded app: the policy that governs every write, the
invariants that are proven at deploy and enforced at runtime, the functions that
run trusted code, and the actor model that decides who is acting. The proof loop
is `bounded verify`; `bounded deploy` compiles and pushes; runtime rule and
invariant checks fail closed. For CLI/deploy see the **bounded-deploy** skill; for
the client SDK and auth UI see **bounded-frontend**; to route across the family,
see the root **bounded** skill.

Write the actor model in mind from the start: know who `@user` is, which principal
a function acts as (`runAs`/`actAs`), and where authorization comes from
(`@origin`) before you write a rule.

## Error Router

| Error/status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `403` | A write or function invoke failed a rule. Check auth, ownership, roles, or function `auth`. Denied reads are hidden as `200` with empty data, not `403`. |
| `409` + invariant name | The transaction would violate an invariant. Fix state or policy. |
| `DISPROVED` + counterexample | The proof found a breaking assignment. Fix every blocking result and verify again; only non-blocking advisories are reviewable. |
| Static validation error | Fix policy syntax, field types, tier/invariant pairing, constants, or expression use. |

## Rules Of Thumb

- Use `@user.id` for normal ownership and membership checks; `@user.address` only for wallet/onchain semantics.
- Denied reads return empty `200` responses. Test read denial with a different permitted identity, not by waiting for a read `403`.
- Use `conserve` for money-like values; `rollingSum` for caps over time; one atomic `set-many` when correctness spans multiple writes.
- Put provider API keys in Bounded secrets, not frontend code.
- Know the acting principal before writing a rule: a function's `runAs`/`actAs` and `@origin` decide who `@user` is and whether the call is authorized.
