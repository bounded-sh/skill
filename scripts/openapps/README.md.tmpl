# OpenApps skill

Agent skills for building apps on [OpenApps](https://openapps.xyz).

An OpenApps app gets hosted data, auth, functions, files, payments, realtime
state and web hosting under one app identity, plus its own agent. You declare
collections, access rules and invariants in `policy.json`; every write that
breaks one is refused before it commits.

## Install

The OpenApps CLI is a project dev dependency (macOS, Linux and Windows; Node 20
or later). `openapps init` installs these skills for the agents on the machine:

```bash
npm install -D openapps
npx openapps init
```

To refresh only the skills in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and other agents that
read `SKILL.md`, name the agents you use:

```bash
npx skills add poofdotnew/openapps-skill -g -y --agent claude-code codex cursor
```

Using Codex, Cursor or Windsurf without skills? Grab the drop-in blocks in
[`agents/`](agents/).
