  Ship and configure a Bounded app: the bounded CLI (init, verify, deploy, share,
  dashboard), multi-environment policy files, local live-edit deploys, custom
  domains and vanity slugs, and account/project config (bounded.json, account
  profiles, credentials, key safety). Use when deploying, releasing, sharing
  access, or configuring the project and its accounts. Part of the Bounded skill
  family; policy authoring lives in bounded-backend, client work in
  bounded-frontend.

# Bounded deploy

How a Bounded app is built, shipped, configured, and shared. `bounded deploy`
validates, compiles, and pushes the policy (it re-runs the proof gate and fails
closed on a regression). This skill covers the CLI, environments, live-edit,
domains, and the account/config surface. Policy content lives in the
**bounded-backend** skill. To route across the family, see the root **bounded**
skill.

| Share an app / add a collaborator / grant admin, deploy, or billing rights | `bounded share <email-or-wallet> --role admin\|developer\|viewer\|billing --app-id <id>` (owner-only). Do NOT hunt for an allowlist in app code; the control plane governs access. Capability matrix in the **bounded-backend** skill's access-control doc. |
| Hit `requires a keypair` / `401` / `403` on deploy/site deploy, or about to conclude "blocked on the owner" / "no access" | [docs/access-playbook.md](docs/access-playbook.md) — DON'T give up. Run `bounded whoami` + `bounded access --app-id <id>`; switch identity (`account use --web`/`--global`); web-account deploys work (update the CLI if it refuses). |

## Setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.bounded.sh/install.sh | sh
bounded init
bounded deploy --create --name my-app
bounded verify
bounded dashboard
```

`bounded init` writes `policy.json` and public project config. The CLI then uses the account source that config selects: wallet/keypair mode (`global`, `project`, `profile`, or `env`) or web-account mode (`bounded account use --web` then `bounded login`). Do not commit private keys or secrets.

## Rules Of Thumb

- Read project config first when entering an existing app; it tells you which app/environment/account source to use.
- Claim a vanity slug with `bounded domains slug ...` and share the slug/custom-domain host, never a raw app-id host, as the public URL.
- To give a person or agent access, reach straight for `bounded share ... --role ...`; confirm with `bounded access --app-id <id> --json`.
- Never conclude "no access / blocked on the owner" from a `requires a keypair`/`401`/`403`. Run `bounded whoami` + `bounded access --app-id <id>` and check under each identity first — see [docs/access-playbook.md](docs/access-playbook.md).
- `bounded deploy` re-runs the proof gate; a `DISPROVED` result blocks the deploy. See the bounded-backend skill for counterexamples.
