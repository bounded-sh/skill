  Add onchain to a Bounded app: Solana and EVM collections, embedded
  non-custodial wallets (@user.address on every login, Crossmint), client- and
  server-signed transactions, DEX/perps trading patterns, and crypto payments
  (accept USDC/crypto non-custodially, Bounded Pay for card/fiat). Use for wallet,
  token, on-chain transaction, or crypto/fiat payment work. Part of the Bounded
  skill family; policy and the actor model live in bounded-backend.

# Bounded onchain

Wallets, tokens, on-chain transactions, and payments. The **canonical Bounded
login gives every user a wallet**: turn on `auth.wallets` (Crossmint, non-custodial)
and every email/social login carries a real `@user.address` — see
[docs/embedded-wallets.md](docs/embedded-wallets.md). `@user.id` (the account id)
stays the identity/ownership key; `@user.address` is the wallet. On-chain writes
still pass their policy rules and invariants first, so pair this with the
**bounded-backend** skill for the governing rules. To route across the family, see
the root **bounded** skill.

## Rules Of Thumb

- **Default onchain login = `auth.wallets` + wallet login, side by side.** Turn on `{ "auth": { "wallets": true } }` in policy so email/social users get a Crossmint wallet (the primary path), and add bring-your-own **wallet login** (`walletLogin`) for users who already hold a Solana wallet. See [docs/embedded-wallets.md → recommended login](docs/embedded-wallets.md#the-recommended-login-for-an-onchain-app). Prescribe this for any onchain app.
- Use `@user.address` only for wallet/onchain semantics; use `@user.id` for normal ownership. See the bounded-backend skill.
- For onchain writes, use explicit network/RPC configuration and devnet by default; do not treat immediate read-after-write as confirmation.
- Treat compiler support and deployed-program support as separate capabilities. Never emit runtime-v2 primitives for a runtime-v1 deployment; follow [docs/policy-primitives.md](docs/policy-primitives.md).
- Treat runtime-v3 governance the same way: enroll only after the deployed capability registry reports v3, and publish governance from observed chain state rather than policy intent.
- Keep Poofnet and Solana behavior paired. Pure/read primitives must return the same shape, and mutating primitives must apply a modeled effect or fail closed; validation-only success is a parity bug.
- Bounded Pay's 1% platform fee is in addition to Stripe's own processing fees.
- Crypto is accepted non-custodially; sellers settle to their own wallet.
