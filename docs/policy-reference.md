# Policy Reference — `policy.json`

**What's in here / when to read this:** the `policy.json` syntax reference —
path templates, field types, the rule expression language, tiers, and every
config key. (Invariants: [invariants.md](invariants.md).)

One JSON file defines the backend: collections, types, auth rules, side-effect
hooks, schedules, webhooks, search, and invariants. Everything is validated at
deploy; the constraints are proven. Invariants get their own doc:
[invariants.md](invariants.md). For the method of *generating* a policy, see
[policy-generation-guide.md](policy-generation-guide.md).

## Collections & path templates

Top-level keys (other than `links`) are **path templates**. Segments alternate
between a collection name and a `$variable` (the document id), so paths always have
an even number of segments:

```json
{
  "tenants/$tenantId/invoices/$invoiceId": {
    "fields":     { "...": "..." },
    "rules":      { "read": "...", "create": "...", "update": "...", "delete": "..." },
    "tier":       "durable",
    "invariants": []
  }
}
```

- Collection names: letters and digits, starting with a letter.
- Id segments: `$camelCase` (alphanumeric after `$`) — they become **path
  variables** usable in rules and invariants (`$tenantId == @user.id`).
- Nesting encodes ownership: a write to `tenants/t1/invoices/i9` binds
  `$tenantId = "t1"` for every rule on that template.
- Two templates may not collide modulo variable names — `users/$a` and `users/$b`
  together is a deploy error.

## Fields

`fields` maps names to types. Names start with a letter and contain only
alphanumerics and underscores; `id`, `pathId`, `_id`, and `tarobase_*` names are
reserved.

The accepted scalar type names are **exactly** `String`, `Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`,
`Float`, `Address` (plus the `?` / `!` suffixes below). Anything else is rejected
at deploy.

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `String` | UTF-8 string. Required for `tenantTag`/`tenantEdge` fields. |
| `Int` | Signed safe integer. |
| `UInt` | Unsigned safe integer. **Required for `rollingSum` fields.** |
| `Bool` | true / false. **`Boolean` is NOT a valid type name — use `Bool`.** |
| `Float` | Decimal. **Not allowed on onchain collections** — use Int/UInt. |
| `Address` | Wallet / account address. |

> **`Bool`, not `Boolean`.** `deploy` rejects `"Boolean"` with
> `unrecognized data type "Boolean"` (and `verify` is being aligned to reject it
> too — don't rely on `verify` passing it). There is no `Number`, `Timestamp`, or
> `Date` scalar — model timestamps as `UInt` (Unix seconds) and lists as
> sub-collections.

Suffixes compose with every base type:

- `?` — optional (`String?`)
- `!` — **readonly after create** (`String!`) — adds an immutability **proof
  obligation** the deploy gate checks. It is **opt-in per field** and does **not**
  auto-generate the enforcement: you must still write the preservation clause in
  the `update` rule yourself, or deploy fails (see below).
- `!?` — both (`String!?`)

There are **no array or object field types**. Model a list as a sub-collection.

### `!` requires a preservation clause in the update rule

Marking a field `!` adds the obligation *"no payload satisfying the update rule
can change this field"* — but the engine does **not** synthesize the check for
you. If your `update` rule admits any write that changes the field, deploy fails
with e.g. `field immutability` / `<field> is immutable on update`. You must add
`@newData.X == @data.X` for **each** `!` field to the update rule:

```json
"posts/$id": {
  "fields": { "author": "String!", "createdAt": "UInt!", "body": "String" },
  "rules": {
    "create": "@user.id != null && @newData.author == @user.id",
    "update": "@user.id == @data.author && @newData.author == @data.author && @newData.createdAt == @data.createdAt",
    "delete": "@user.id == @data.author"
  }
}
```

Fields that typically need this: identity/ownership (`owner`, `author`,
`creator`), creation timestamps (`createdAt`), and any set-once key. (An
`update: "false"` rule satisfies the obligation vacuously — nothing can change
the field because nothing can update at all — which is why server-authoritative
collections never hit this.) Note: a tenant-tag field bound by a `tenantTag`
invariant does **not** need `!` — the invariant rebinds it on every write.

## Rules & the expression language

`rules` gates `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete` with boolean expressions. A
false rule rejects with `403` + a trace, and the prover analyzes the same
expressions at deploy. **An omitted rule defaults to deny.**

```json
"rules": {
  "read":   "@user.id != null && @data.ownerId == @user.id",
  "create": "@user.id != null && @newData.ownerId == @user.id",
  "update": "@data.ownerId == @user.id && @newData.ownerId == @data.ownerId",
  "delete": "@data.ownerId == @user.id"
}
```

### Variables

| Variable | Meaning | Restrictions |
|---|---|---|
| `@user.id` | Universal stable identity of the authenticated caller; **always present** for an authenticated user (`null` when unauthenticated). For wallet logins it equals the wallet address; for email/social logins it is the account identity. **Use this for ownership / membership / identity / auth guards.** | — |
| `@user.address` | A **real onchain wallet address**. Present for wallet logins, **`null` for email-only logins**. Use **only** for onchain operations / wallet semantics. | The **only** identity variable allowed in `onchain: true` collections |
| `@user.email` | The verified, lowercased email (email logins only; `null` for wallet logins). Use for email-gating. | **Forbidden** in `onchain: true` collections |
| `@data.field` | Existing document | **not** in `create` rules |
| `@newData.field` | Incoming document | **not** in `delete` rules |
| `@time.now` | Server time (seconds) | — |
| `@contract.address` | The app's contract/escrow address (onchain) | — |
| `$pathVariable` | Any variable from the path template | — |
| `get(/path)` | Read another doc, **staged in-batch** state (committed + earlier in-batch writes overlaid — **not** pre-batch for a doc written earlier in the same batch) | unquoted path, leading `/` |
| `getAfter(/path)` | Read another doc, **staged** state (same view as `get` for already-staged docs) | not in `read` rules |

> **The `user` object & the three identity variables.** The SDK `user` object is
> `{ id: string, address: string | null, email: string | null }`, mirrored in
> rules as `@user.id`, `@user.address`, `@user.email`:
> - **`@user.id`** — the universal stable identity, **always present** for an
>   authenticated user. Equals the wallet address for wallet logins; the account
>   identity for email/social (Bounded Better Auth) logins. **This is what you
>   compare for ownership, membership, and identity** (`owner == @user.id`,
>   `$userId == @user.id`, `get(/orgs/$orgId/members/@user.id)`, allowlist gates,
>   and the bare auth guard `@user.id != null`).
> - **`@user.address`** — a real onchain wallet address; `null` for email-only
>   logins. Use it **only** for onchain / wallet semantics.
> - **`@user.email`** — the verified, lowercased email; `null` for wallet logins.
>   Use it for email-gating.
>
> **HARD RULE for `onchain: true` collections:** `@user.id` and `@user.email` are
> **forbidden** there; only `@user.address` is allowed. Everywhere else (offchain
> ownership/membership/auth), prefer `@user.id` — it is the one variable
> guaranteed to be non-null for every authenticated caller regardless of login
> method.

`get(/users/$userId).role` — property access chains off the call. `@data` /
`@newData` must reference a specific field (`@data.foo`, never bare `@data`).

> **There is no `@constants`.** The only special variables are `@user.id`,
> `@user.address`, `@user.email`, `@data`, `@newData`, `@time.now`,
> `@contract.address`. Express "admin" by comparing a `get()`-read role field
> against `@user.id` (e.g. `get(/admins/@user.id) != null`) or a literal address —
> not a constant.

### Operators & literals

- Logic: `&&`, `||`; comparisons `==` `!=` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`.
- Arithmetic: `+` `-` `*` `//` (integer division) `**`. **Plain `/` is reserved
  for paths — using it for division is a validation error.**
- Literals: numbers (decimals only on offchain collections), quoted strings
  (`"..."`, `'...'`, or `` `...` ``), `true`, `false`, `null`.
- **No ternary, no switch, no string concatenation.** Branch with
  `(cond && A) || (!cond && B)` chained. Build paths by embedding variables
  directly: `get(/teams/@newData.teamId/members/@user.id)`.

### Plugin functions in rules

Rules may call read-only plugin functions, e.g. `@StringUtils.length(@newData.body)
<= 280`. Transactional plugin calls belong in hooks, not rules. Available plugins
depend on the deployment; the validator rejects unknown identifiers.

### Semantic constraints the validator enforces

- `@data` cannot appear in `create` rules (nothing exists yet); `@newData` cannot
  appear in `delete` rules (nothing is being written).
- Collections declared `"onchain": true` must use `"read": "true"` — onchain data
  is public and the validator rejects pretending otherwise.
- Onchain rules cannot `get()` an offchain collection.

## Tiers

| Tier | Semantics | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `durable` | Committed before the caller sees success. **Required** for `rollingSum` and materialized/sharded conservation. | money, ledgers, anything an invariant protects |
| `checkpointed` | Interval-batched to storage; bounded loss window on hard failure. | high-write app state, presence, counters |
| `ephemeral` | In-memory only; gone on restart; fastest. | game ticks, cursors, transient rooms |

Declaring `rollingSum` (or `materialized`/`sharded` conservation) on a non-durable
collection is a **deploy error**, never a silent downgrade.

## Hooks

`hooks.offchain` / `hooks.onchain` attach side effects to `create`/`update`/`delete`.
Offchain hooks call **offchain** plugins — chiefly `@DocumentPlugin`:

```json
"hooks": {
  "offchain": {
    "create": "@DocumentPlugin.updateField(\"counters/global\", \"total\", \"1\")"
  }
}
```

| Offchain hook call | Effect |
|---|---|
| `@DocumentPlugin.putDocument(path, data)` | create/replace a document |
| `@DocumentPlugin.updateField(path, field, value)` | set one field |

Onchain hooks (on `"onchain": true` collections) call onchain plugins like
`@TokenPlugin.transfer(...)`. **An onchain plugin in an offchain hook is rejected.**

Hooks also include `tick` and `scheduled` groups, plus an `enforceRules` flag —
full treatment in [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md):

```json
"hooks": {
  "tick":      { "advance": "@DocumentPlugin.updateField(\"rooms/sys\", \"tick\", \"1\")" },
  "scheduled": { "resetQuota": "@DocumentPlugin.updateField(\"quotas/g\", \"used\", \"0\")" },
  "enforceRules": false
}
```

**Hooks never gate.** There is no throw-from-a-hook. Authorization lives in
`rules`; cross-transaction correctness lives in `invariants`. By default a hook
bypasses the per-actor rules (it is privileged server logic); set `enforceRules`
to hold a hook to the same rules an external caller faces. A hook can never break
a proven invariant.

## Every accepted config key

The validator accepts exactly these keys on a collection (anything else is
rejected):

| Key | Shape | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `fields` | `{ name: Type }` | this doc |
| `rules` | `{ read, create, update, delete }` | this doc |
| `tier` | `"durable" \| "checkpointed" \| "ephemeral"` | this doc |
| `invariants` | array of invariant objects | [invariants.md](invariants.md) |
| `onchain` | boolean | [proof-coverage.md](proof-coverage.md) |
| `hooks` | `{ offchain, onchain, tick, scheduled, enforceRules }` | [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md) |
| `enforceRules` | boolean (collection-level) | [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md) |
| `schedule` | `{ every, run }` or an array of them | [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md) |
| `dueRows` | `{ run, onComplete?, doneField? }` | [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md) |
| `webhooks` | `[{ url, on: [...] }]` | [hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md](hooks-scheduled-webhooks.md) |
| `search` | `{ fields: [...] }` | [files-and-search.md](files-and-search.md) |
| `queries` | `{ name: { returnType, query } }` | [queries.md](queries.md) |
| `session` | `{ settleTo, settleFrom, settleRule, checkpointSeconds, tick }` | [realtime-and-games.md](realtime-and-games.md) |
| `relationships` | `{ name: { type, collection, ... } }` | [queries.md](queries.md) |
| `type` | `"llm" \| "api" \| "storage"` | [files-and-search.md](files-and-search.md) |
| `service` / `model` / `prompt` | strings (for `type:"api"`/`"llm"`) | [files-and-search.md](files-and-search.md) |
| `isPassthrough` / `isRevealPath` | booleans (onchain) | [proof-coverage.md](proof-coverage.md) |
| `description` / `operationDetails` / `functionDescription` | docstrings | — |

### Top-level blocks (alongside the collection keys)

These reserved keys live at the policy root, **not** under a collection, and are
never treated as path templates:

| Block | Shape | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `links` | array of link definitions | [queries.md](queries.md) |
| `functions` | `{ name: { auth, entry, timeout, secrets } }` | [functions.md](functions.md) |
| `roles` | `{ name: { members, read?, write? } }` — provably-scoped cross-collection grants | [roles.md](roles.md) |
| `constants` | `{ NAME: string\|number\|bool }` — values for `@const.NAME` | [constants-and-defs.md](constants-and-defs.md) |
| `defs` | `{ name: "rule fragment" }` — reusable `@def.name` fragments | [constants-and-defs.md](constants-and-defs.md) |
| `attestations` | `[{ claim, kind, ... }]` — GLOBAL, policy-wide proven claims (see notes below) | [invariants.md](invariants.md#attestations--global-policy-wide-claims) |
| `environments` | `{ name: { appId, constants } }` — **CLI-only**, resolved client-side | [environments.md](environments.md) |

`constants`/`defs` are resolved at compile time (deploy + verify) so rules carry
only literals; `environments` is stripped by the CLI before the policy is sent.

**Attestation scope notes (nested vs flat):**

- `roleGatedRead` with a flat `role` (`<collection>/$docId`, e.g.
  `members/$memberId`) derives the membership predicate automatically. With a
  **nested** `role` (e.g. `tenants/$tenantId/members/$memberId`) you **must** add
  an explicit **`gatedBy`** membership predicate — the default derivation only
  handles the flat shape. Worked example:
  [invariants.md](invariants.md#nested-role-scopes--rolegatedread-needs-gatedby).
- `authorityClosure` supports **only a flat `roleScope`** (`admins/$address`);
  nested role scopes are not yet supported. For multi-tenant admin sets use a flat
  `admins/$address` registry — see
  [invariants.md](invariants.md#nested-authority--authorityclosure-is-flat-only-known-limitation).
